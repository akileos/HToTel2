This is a stupid simple HTTP over Telnet over Telnet forwarder.

Example usage :

You have access to your company gateway router using telnet
You want to access internal webserver from outside without using NAT 

Let's give it a try :

$ python HToTel2.py -p telnet_password -t your.public.ip.addr -d some.internal.server

Open up a browser and browse to :
http://locahost:23238

Enjoy.

All fixes and improvements are really welcome, I'm still a begginer in Python.
